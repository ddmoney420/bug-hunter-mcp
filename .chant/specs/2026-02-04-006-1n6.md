# P1: Conceptual Dependency Graph & Learning Progression

## Background

From ROADMAP.md: Visual dependency graph showing how CS concepts relate. Shows prerequisites and progression paths.

## Requirements

### Dependency Graph
- Map concept prerequisites (e.g., "locks" → "atomics" → "race conditions")
- Generate ASCII visualization for terminal
- Track learning depth per concept

### Recommendations
- Suggest "next bug" based on mastered concepts
- Show prerequisite gaps

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create src/graph.ts with dependency definitions
- [ ] Define ≥15 concept nodes with prerequisites
- [ ] Create `show_graph` MCP tool for ASCII visualization
- [ ] Create `next_bug` MCP tool for recommendations
- [ ] Graph shows concept relationships clearly
- [ ] Build succeeds with `npm run build`
- [ ] All tests pass with `npm test`
