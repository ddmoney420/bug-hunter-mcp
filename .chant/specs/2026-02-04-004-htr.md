# Implement Issue Taxonomy with Problem-Solving Strategy Patterns

## Background

From ROADMAP.md P1: Build a searchable taxonomy that categorizes issues by problem type and pairs each with proven debugging strategies. Teaches metacognitive skill: "how to approach different problem types."

## Requirements

### 1. Issue Categories (≥8 types)

Define problem categories:
- race-condition
- memory-leak
- incorrect-logic
- api-incompatibility
- type-mismatch
- null-reference
- performance-bottleneck
- encoding-error

### 2. Strategy Mappings

Each category maps to 2-3 recommended debugging strategies with tools:
- Example: `race-condition` → ["add logging with timestamps", "use thread sanitizer", "review lock ordering"]

### 3. New MCP Tool: `get_strategy`

Given an issue category, returns:
- Category description
- Recommended debugging strategies
- Suggested tools (strace, profilers, debuggers, etc.)
- Success tips from past bugs

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Create src/taxonomy.ts with ≥8 issue categories
- [x] Each category has 2-3 debugging strategies documented
- [x] Each strategy includes recommended tools
- [x] Create `get_strategy` MCP tool that looks up by category
- [x] Integrate with `hunt_issues` to suggest category when displaying issues
- [x] Build succeeds with `npm run build`
- [x] All tests pass with `npm test`

I'll start by reading the current spec to understand the full requirements and acceptance criteria.
Good, I can see the spec is already in progress. Let me create a todo list and then start exploring the codebase to understand the structure.
Now let me explore the codebase structure:
Let me read the package.json and main source files:
Now let me check the existing file structure and look for any existing taxonomy file:
Let me check if taxonomy.ts already exists:
Let me mark the first todo as completed and start implementing:
Now I'll create the taxonomy.ts file with comprehensive issue categories and debugging strategies:
Now let me update the todo and add the get_strategy MCP tool to index.ts:
Now I'll add the import and the get_strategy tool to index.ts. First, let me add the import statement after the validators import:
Now I need to add the get_strategy tool definition to the tools array. Let me find a good location and add it after the research_workflow tool:
Now I need to add the implementation function for get_strategy. Let me find where to add it and then add it in the switch statement. First, let me add the function implementation before the server setup:
Now I need to add the case statement for get_strategy in the tool call handler:
Now let me update the todo and integrate category suggestions into the hunt_issues function:
Now let me modify the hunt_issues function to suggest categories. I'll update the part where it returns the issue results:
Now let me build and test the code:
Great! The build succeeded. Now let me run the tests:
Perfect! All tests passed. Now let me check the git status and verify the build is clean:
Now I need to update the acceptance criteria in the spec file. Let me read it first to see its current state:
Now let me update the spec with all acceptance criteria checked and add the model field:
Now let me update the acceptance criteria to check off all items:
Perfect! Now let me update my todo list and commit the changes:
Now let me commit the changes:
Let me check what files are actually in dist:
The files exist but git might not be tracking them. Let me try a simpler approach:
Perfect! Now let me verify the git status is clean:
Excellent! Now let me mark the final todo as completed and verify the implementation one more time:
Perfect! Let me verify the implementation by checking the spec file one final time:
Perfect! All acceptance criteria are now checked. Let me verify the build one last time to ensure everything is clean:
Excellent! Let me create a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary

I have successfully implemented the **Issue Taxonomy with Problem-Solving Strategy Patterns** spec. Here's what was completed:

### ✅ All Acceptance Criteria Met

1. **Created `src/taxonomy.ts`** with **10 issue categories** (exceeding the ≥8 requirement):
   - `race-condition` - Multi-threaded synchronization issues
   - `memory-leak` - Allocated memory not freed
   - `incorrect-logic` - Algorithm/business logic errors
   - `api-incompatibility` - Version mismatches or API usage errors
   - `type-mismatch` - Data type incompatibilities
   - `null-reference` - Null/undefined access errors
   - `performance-bottleneck` - CPU/memory/I/O performance issues
   - `encoding-error` - Character encoding mismatches
   - `deadlock` - Circular waits causing hangs
   - `assertion-error` - Broken invariants or preconditions

2. **Each category has 2-3 debugging strategies** with:
   - Strategy name and detailed description
   - Step-by-step debugging approach (4-5 steps each)
   - Recommended tools for each strategy
   - Real-world success tips

3. **New `get_strategy` MCP tool** that:
   - Takes a category ID as input
   - Returns formatted debugging strategy with all details
   - Lists recommended tools for each strategy
   - Provides success tips from past bugs

4. **Integrated with `hunt_issues`** to:
   - Suggest issue categories when displaying results
   - Guide users to use `get_strategy` for debugging approaches
   - Help users understand problem types before diving into code

5. **Build & Tests:**
   - ✅ `npm run build` succeeds with no errors
   - ✅ All 62 tests pass

6. **Committed with spec reference:**
   - Commit: `chant(2026-02-04-004-htr): Implement Issue Taxonomy...`
   - Includes full model attribution
   - Clean working tree

The taxonomy teaches metacognitive skills by helping developers understand "how to approach different problem types" systematically, with proven debugging strategies and recommended tools for each issue category.```
