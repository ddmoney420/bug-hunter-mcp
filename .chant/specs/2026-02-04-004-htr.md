# Implement Issue Taxonomy with Problem-Solving Strategy Patterns

## Background

From ROADMAP.md P1: Build a searchable taxonomy that categorizes issues by problem type and pairs each with proven debugging strategies. Teaches metacognitive skill: "how to approach different problem types."

## Requirements

### 1. Issue Categories (≥8 types)

Define problem categories:
- race-condition
- memory-leak
- incorrect-logic
- api-incompatibility
- type-mismatch
- null-reference
- performance-bottleneck
- encoding-error

### 2. Strategy Mappings

Each category maps to 2-3 recommended debugging strategies with tools:
- Example: `race-condition` → ["add logging with timestamps", "use thread sanitizer", "review lock ordering"]

### 3. New MCP Tool: `get_strategy`

Given an issue category, returns:
- Category description
- Recommended debugging strategies
- Suggested tools (strace, profilers, debuggers, etc.)
- Success tips from past bugs

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Create src/taxonomy.ts with ≥8 issue categories
- [x] Each category has 2-3 debugging strategies documented
- [x] Each strategy includes recommended tools
- [x] Create `get_strategy` MCP tool that looks up by category
- [x] Integrate with `hunt_issues` to suggest category when displaying issues
- [x] Build succeeds with `npm run build`
- [x] All tests pass with `npm test`
