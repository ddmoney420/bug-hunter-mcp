# Codecrafters analysis and platform comparison

Analyze Codecrafters' educational approach and document three successful patterns that differ from or complement Exercism's approach.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Codecrafters section documents 3 successful patterns with explanations (≥150 words total)
- [ ] Each Codecrafters pattern explains learning effectiveness
- [ ] Analysis compares/contrasts with Exercism where relevant
- [ ] Patterns focus on hands-on, project-based learning aspects

### Edge Cases

- Platform access limitations: Use publicly available documentation, blog posts, and community feedback if full access unavailable
- Overlap with Exercism: Highlight differences and complementary approaches, not duplicates

### Example Test Cases

For this research, verify:
- Codecrafters section is complete with 3 distinct patterns
- Patterns might cover: building real tools, progressive difficulty, multi-language implementation
- Analysis connects patterns to potential bug-hunter-mcp applications
