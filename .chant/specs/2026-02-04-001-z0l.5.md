# Create ROADMAP.md with prioritized enhancements

Create ROADMAP.md organizing the researched enhancements into priority tiers (P0, P1, P2) based on impact and feasibility.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] ROADMAP.md created with P0, P1, P2 sections
- [x] P0 contains ≥2 high-impact items with clear success criteria
- [x] P1 contains ≥3 medium-impact items
- [x] P2 contains ≥2 nice-to-have items
- [x] Each roadmap item links back to corresponding enhancement in RESEARCH.md

### Edge Cases

- Prioritization rationale: Include brief justification for P0 vs P1 placement focusing on learning impact and implementation dependencies
- Success criteria definition: P0 items must have measurable outcomes (e.g., "pass rate visible in stats" not "better tracking")

### Example Test Cases

For the roadmap, verify:
- P0 might include: enhanced quiz validation, concept retention metrics, or improved lesson templates
- P1 might include: difficulty tagging, progress dashboards, or community showcase
- P2 might include: gamification, AI-generated hints, or multi-language support
- Each tier is ordered by priority within the tier
