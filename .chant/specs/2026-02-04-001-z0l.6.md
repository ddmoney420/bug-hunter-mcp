# Draft spec for top P0 enhancement

Create a draft chant spec for the highest-priority P0 enhancement identified in ROADMAP.md, ready for execution.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Draft spec file created in .chant/specs/ (pending status)
- [ ] Spec includes clear problem statement and solution approach
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are specific and testable (3-5 checkboxes)
- [ ] Target files identified (if applicable)

### Edge Cases

- Spec scope: Ensure draft spec is focused enough for independent execution (not an umbrella spec requiring further splitting)
- Criteria clarity: Each checkbox should be verifiable by running tests or observing behavior, not subjective

### Example Test Cases

For the draft spec, verify:
- If P0 is "quiz validation", spec might check: quiz format validation, passing threshold enforcement, retry logic
- Spec follows chant conventions: frontmatter, acceptance criteria, edge cases considered
- Spec is immediately actionable without additional research
