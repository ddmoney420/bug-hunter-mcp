# Implement Difficulty & Concept Tagging System for LESSONS.md

## Background

From ROADMAP.md P0 priority: Add metadata to bug entries enabling structured learning progressions and pattern recognition across issues.

## Requirements

### 1. LESSONS.md Frontmatter Schema

Add YAML frontmatter to each bug entry section in LESSONS.md:

```yaml
difficulty: easy | medium | hard
concepts:
  - concept-name-1
  - concept-name-2
```

### 2. New MCP Tool: `filter_lessons`

Create a tool that filters LESSONS.md entries by:
- `difficulty`: Filter by skill level
- `concepts`: Filter by CS concept tags
- Returns matching bug entries with metadata

### 3. Concept Statistics

Track and display:
- Concepts mastered per session
- Cross-bug pattern detection ("you've seen this pattern in N other bugs")

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Define difficulty enum (easy/medium/hard) with clear rubric
- [x] Define initial concept taxonomy (≥10 CS concepts)
- [x] Add frontmatter to existing LESSONS.md entries
- [x] Create `filter_lessons` MCP tool with difficulty/concept params
- [x] Tool returns filtered entries with tags visible in output
- [x] Build succeeds with `npm run build`
- [x] All tests pass with `npm test`

## Technical Notes

- Parse LESSONS.md sections using markdown-it or regex
- Concept taxonomy: race-conditions, async-await, memory-management, type-systems, error-handling, testing, api-design, caching, concurrency, io-operations
