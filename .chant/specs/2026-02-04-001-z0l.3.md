# Deno PR #31985 case study analysis

Write detailed case study (≥200 words) analyzing the learning outcomes from fixing Deno PR #31985, documenting which CS concepts were retained and which were not.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Case study section is ≥200 words
- [ ] Documents at least 3 concepts that stuck (with explanations why)
- [ ] Documents at least 2 concepts that didn't stick (with analysis of barriers)
- [ ] Includes reflection on what made certain concepts memorable

### Edge Cases

- Concept retention measurement: If concepts are all retained, explain why the learning was effective rather than forcing "what didn't stick"
- Technical depth: Balance between specific Deno/TypeScript details and transferable CS principles

### Example Test Cases

For this analysis, verify:
- Case study covers concepts like: Rust FFI, TypeScript error handling, V8 APIs, or testing strategies
- "Stuck" concepts explain emotional/practical anchors (debugging frustration, aha moments, repeated practice)
- "Didn't stick" analysis identifies gaps (lack of follow-up, complexity, insufficient context)
