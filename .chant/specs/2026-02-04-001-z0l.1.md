# Create RESEARCH.md structure and Exercism analysis

Create the RESEARCH.md file with the complete structure outlined in the driver spec, and analyze Exercism's approach to CS education, documenting three key successful patterns.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] RESEARCH.md created with all section headers (Exercism, Codecrafters, Case Study, Feature Enhancements, Conclusion)
- [x] Exercism section documents 3 successful patterns with explanations (≥150 words total)
- [x] Each Exercism pattern includes why it works for learning
- [x] File is well-formatted markdown with proper headers

### Edge Cases

- Educational platform access: If Exercism requires signup, analyze publicly available documentation and GitHub repos instead
- Pattern selection: Focus on patterns applicable to bug-hunter-mcp's learn-by-fixing approach, not just general platform features

### Example Test Cases

For this research, verify:
- RESEARCH.md exists and has expected section structure
- Exercism analysis covers mentorship system, track progression, or test-driven learning patterns
- Each pattern includes concrete examples from Exercism's implementation

```
I'll start by understanding the current state of the project and then create the RESEARCH.md file with the Exercism analysis.
Let me check the project structure to understand the codebase better:
Let me check the directory structure with bash:
Good! I can see RESEARCH.md already exists. Let me check its current content:
Perfect! I can see that RESEARCH.md already exists with extensive content about Codecrafters. However, according to the spec acceptance criteria, I need to ensure it has all required section headers including "Exercism". Let me check if the Exercism section needs to be added or enhanced. Looking at the current content, I see:

1. The file focuses heavily on Codecrafters analysis
2. It has sections for: Overview, Three Successful Educational Patterns, Additional Insights, Conclusion, Case Study, Feature Enhancements, and Sources
3. **Missing**: A dedicated Exercism section that documents 3 successful patterns from Exercism itself

According to the spec, the RESEARCH.md should have these section headers:
- [ ] Exercism
- [ ] Codecrafters  
- [ ] Case Study
- [ ] Feature Enhancements
- [ ] Conclusion

Let me create a plan and then update the file to add the Exercism section at the beginning:
Now I'll add an Exercism section at the beginning of the file. I'll insert it right after the Overview and before the Codecrafters section:
Good! Now let me update the todo to reflect that I've added the Exercism section:
Now let me verify the section headers are properly structured. Let me read the updated file to check the headers:
Perfect! Let me verify the structure matches the spec requirements. According to the acceptance criteria, the file should have:
- ✅ Exercism section (present)
- ✅ Codecrafters section (present)
- ✅ Case Study section (present)
- ✅ Feature Enhancements section (present)
- ✅ Conclusion section (present)

Let me update the todo list:
Let me check the Exercism section to ensure it has proper formatting and all 3 patterns documented with ≥150 words total:
Excellent! The file looks well-structured. Let me count the words in the Exercism section to verify it meets the ≥150 words requirement:
Perfect! The Exercism section has 723 words, well exceeding the 150-word minimum. Let me verify the Codecrafters section also has good structure:
Great! Now let me update the todo list and verify all formatting is correct:
Let me verify the acceptance criteria are met by checking the spec again and matching with what we have:

**Acceptance Criteria Verification:**

1. ✅ **RESEARCH.md created with all section headers** - File exists with headers:
   - Overview
   - Exercism: Mentorship-Driven & Track-Based Learning
   - Codecrafters: Deep Systems Learning Through Project Building
   - (Sub-sections for both platforms)
   - Case Study: Deno PR #31985 - hasColors() Implementation
   - Feature Enhancements for Bug Hunter MCP
   - Conclusion (present in the Codecrafters analysis section)

2. ✅ **Exercism section documents 3 successful patterns with explanations (≥150 words total)** - Has:
   - Mentorship System: Learning Through Code Review (with why it works)
   - Track Progression: Guided Learning Paths (with why it works)
   - Test-Driven Learning: Specifications as Teachers (with why it works)
   - Total: 723 words

3. ✅ **Each Exercism pattern includes why it works for learning** - Each pattern has a "Why It Works for Learning" subsection

4. ✅ **File is well-formatted markdown with proper headers** - Uses proper markdown syntax with # and ## headers

Now let me commit the changes:
Perfect! Now let me commit with the proper message format:
Excellent! The commit was successful. Now let me verify the git status is clean:
Perfect! The RESEARCH.md file is successfully committed. The other changes shown in git status are pre-existing files in the spec system and node_modules that were already tracked at the start of this task. Now let me update the spec to mark the acceptance criteria as complete:
Now let me update the spec to mark all acceptance criteria as complete:
Now let me finalize the spec using the chant command:
Let me check if there's a just command available:
Let me check what chant command is available:
Perfect! Let me use the chant finalize command:
Excellent! The spec has been finalized successfully. Let me update my todo list to mark everything as complete:
Perfect! Let me verify the final state of the work:
Perfect! Let me verify the RESEARCH.md file one more time to ensure all acceptance criteria are met:
Perfect! Let me also verify that all the required sections are present in the file:
Excellent! All required sections are present:
- ✅ Overview
- ✅ Exercism: Mentorship-Driven & Track-Based Learning
- ✅ Codecrafters: Deep Systems Learning Through Project Building
- ✅ Case Study: Deno PR #31985 - hasColors() Implementation
- ✅ Feature Enhancements for Bug Hunter MCP
- ✅ Conclusion
