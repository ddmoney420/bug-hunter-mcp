# Create RESEARCH.md structure and Exercism analysis

Create the RESEARCH.md file with the complete structure outlined in the driver spec, and analyze Exercism's approach to CS education, documenting three key successful patterns.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] RESEARCH.md created with all section headers (Exercism, Codecrafters, Case Study, Feature Enhancements, Conclusion)
- [ ] Exercism section documents 3 successful patterns with explanations (≥150 words total)
- [ ] Each Exercism pattern includes why it works for learning
- [ ] File is well-formatted markdown with proper headers

### Edge Cases

- Educational platform access: If Exercism requires signup, analyze publicly available documentation and GitHub repos instead
- Pattern selection: Focus on patterns applicable to bug-hunter-mcp's learn-by-fixing approach, not just general platform features

### Example Test Cases

For this research, verify:
- RESEARCH.md exists and has expected section structure
- Exercism analysis covers mentorship system, track progression, or test-driven learning patterns
- Each pattern includes concrete examples from Exercism's implementation
