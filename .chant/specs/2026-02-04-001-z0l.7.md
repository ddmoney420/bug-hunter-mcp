# Draft spec for Quick Win enhancement

Create a draft chant spec for one Quick Win (Quick effort) enhancement from the feature list, providing an easy early victory.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Draft spec file created in .chant/specs/ (pending status)
- [ ] Spec targets a Quick Win enhancement from RESEARCH.md
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are minimal but complete (2-4 checkboxes)
- [ ] Spec is scoped for completion in single focused session

### Edge Cases

- Quick Win selection: Choose enhancement with minimal dependencies and clear, narrow scope (e.g., add frontmatter field, not build dashboard)
- Over-engineering prevention: Resist expanding scope beyond the Quick Win classification

### Example Test Cases

For the draft spec, verify:
- If Quick Win is "add difficulty ratings", spec checks: frontmatter schema update, example ratings added, documentation updated
- Spec avoids scope creep: no UI, no complex logic, just foundational change
- Completion verifiable without extensive testing
