# Propose and classify feature enhancements

Research and propose 5 feature enhancements for bug-hunter-mcp as an educational platform, classifying each by implementation effort (Quick/Medium/Large).

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Feature Enhancements section lists 5 distinct proposals
- [ ] Each feature has effort classification (Quick/Medium/Large)
- [ ] Each feature includes 2-3 sentence rationale explaining educational value
- [ ] At least one Quick, one Medium, and one Large enhancement included

### Edge Cases

- Feature overlap: Ensure enhancements are distinct and not sub-tasks of each other
- Effort estimation: Use relative complexity, not time estimates; Quick = <1 day, Medium = 1-3 days, Large = >3 days equivalent effort

### Example Test Cases

For these proposals, verify:
- Features might include: quiz system refinements, progress tracking, concept tagging, difficulty ratings, or community features
- Quick Win example: Add "difficulty: easy/medium/hard" frontmatter to each bug entry
- Large example: Build interactive quiz generator from LESSONS.md using LLM
