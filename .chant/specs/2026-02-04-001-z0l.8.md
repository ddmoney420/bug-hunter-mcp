# Add Enhanced Tool Descriptions and Usage Examples

Create more detailed descriptions for the 9 MCP tools to improve user experience when discovering available functionality. Add practical usage examples that help Claude Code users understand how to use each tool effectively.

## Problem Statement

Currently, the MCP tools have minimal descriptions. When users ask Claude "What tools are available?" or "How do I use this?", the descriptions lack practical detail. Tool discoverbility suffers because:

1. **Minimal Descriptions**: Most tools have 1-sentence descriptions that don't explain real use cases
2. **No Usage Context**: Users don't know when to use each tool or in what order
3. **Missing Relationship Info**: Dependencies between tools (hunt → analyze → scaffold) aren't documented
4. **No Parameter Guidance**: Users don't understand what values to pass to parameters

Example: `hunt_issues` description is just "Find good first issues matching your skills" but doesn't explain language/skill filtering, minimum stars parameter, or typical workflow.

## Solution Approach

### Phase 1: Enhance Tool Descriptions
Update each of the 9 tools' description field to:
- Explain what the tool does in 2-3 sentences
- Include a practical use case example
- Note any prerequisites or related tools
- Clarify parameter purposes

### Phase 2: Add inputSchema Documentation
For tools with multiple parameters, add helpful descriptions to each input parameter:
- What the parameter controls
- Valid value ranges or formats
- Example values
- Optional vs required indicators

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Tool descriptions updated for all 9 tools with enhanced context
- [ ] Each description includes a practical use case example
- [ ] Parameter descriptions added for all input fields
- [ ] Tool descriptions mention related tools where applicable
- [ ] No TypeScript errors with `npm run build`
- [ ] Descriptions are clear and actionable for Claude users

## Target Files

- `src/index.ts` - Update tool descriptions and input parameter documentation

## Edge Cases to Handle

- Keep descriptions concise (avoid excessive length that makes Claude less likely to use them)
- Avoid redundancy across similar tools
- Ensure examples are realistic and show common workflows
- Consider that Claude sees these descriptions, so phrase them for an AI assistant's understanding

## Example Test Cases

For `hunt_issues`, verify:
- Description explains language filtering and min_stars parameter
- Use case example shows: "Find Rust beginner issues with 100+ stars"
- Parameters documented: language, limit (1-30), min_stars (0+)
- Related tools mentioned: "Use with analyze_repo to study the codebase"

For `analyze_repo`, verify:
- Description explains repo cloning and structure analysis
- Use case example shows: "Analyze zigtools/zls to understand its architecture"
- Clarifies what info you get: "Lists files, detects project type, summarizes structure"
- Prerequisites mentioned: "Requires valid GitHub repo (owner/repo format)"

## Success Criteria

1. ✅ All 9 tools have meaningful, detailed descriptions (not single sentences)
2. ✅ Input parameters documented with purpose and valid ranges
3. ✅ Practical examples show how tools work together in workflows
4. ✅ Build completes without TypeScript errors
5. ✅ Descriptions are helpful to users discovering tools via Claude
